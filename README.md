# Welcome!

Hello! I'm TheDecentralizedVeteran, a Marine Corps Veteran dedicated to promoting decentralized technologies to enhance privacy, security, and freedom of expression—values I cherish as an American and defender of freedom.

## About This Project

This Project is dedicated to helping non-tech related people like myself contribute to decentralization because that's how we get better as a society and move forward. Our mission is to empower everyone to participate in building a decentralized future.

Through this project, we aim to:

- **Promote Privacy:** Implement solutions that protect user data and communication from unauthorized access.
- **Enhance Security:** Develop tools and protocols that fortify defenses against cyber threats.
- **Uphold Freedom of Expression:** Ensure everyone has the ability to communicate and express themselves freely without censorship.

## Accomplishments

- **Successfully Implemented NIP-05 Verification:**
  - **What is a NIP?** A NIP is a Nostr Improvement Proposal; these are technical specifications proposed as upgrades for the Nostr protocol.
    - **What is NIP-05?** NIP-05 is a verification method for Nostr accounts across all clients. Similar to the blue checkmark on Twitter or Instagram, NIP-05 allows users to verify their accounts independently, ensuring that Nostr clients recognize and respect the verification. This implementation enhances trust and credibility within the Nostr ecosystem, empowering users with a decentralized and user-controlled verification process.
- **Next up is to implement a Nostr Relay.**
